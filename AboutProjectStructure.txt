bin: executable utilities, for libs that come with some executables
doc: if you need to include some documentation
lib: each app module gets a corresponding dir under lib/
deep_space: a module has a corresponding folder. It has two classes (Spaceship and Probe)
deep_space.rb: it's a convenience file that includes all other necessary files, so that in the app code I need only to include deep_space.rb
test: contains the tests
init.rb: contains the main application code. It may include the deep_space.rb and kick off the app logic
